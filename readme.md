Alan Turing raised a very intersting question, Can machines think ?. He even proved it at his time and wthout his contributions we would not typing on this machine today and you would not have been reading. 
Esya is a sanskrit word which means a future which is about to come. We are just starting this project to try few random things. This is no where close to a thinking machine but yes its our step towards the mysterious land. Feel free to add sugesstions or feedback.
